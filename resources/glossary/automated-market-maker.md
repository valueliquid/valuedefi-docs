# Automated market maker

**Automated market maker** =  Automated market makers are smart contracts that hold liquidity reserves \(or liquidity pools\) that traders can trade against. These reserves are funded by liquidity providers. Anyone can be a liquidity provider who deposits an equivalent value of two tokens in the pool. In return, traders pay a fee to the pool that is then distributed to liquidity providers according to their share of the pool. \(taken from [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-uniswap-and-how-does-it-work](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-uniswap-and-how-does-it-work)\)
