# Vision & Mission

**1. Accessibility**

VALUEâ€™s emission schedule was purposefully designed for a much longer period, allowing for multiple staking asset options and pools in order to reach the broader community. With an easy-to-use user interface and detailed instructions, VALUE is designed with accessibility and user experience in mind.

**2. Governance**

VALUE enables access to a sleeker and more effective on-chain voting model that introduces flexible voting parameters. The governance model is first of its kind and allows for free of cost and publicly verifiable votes by VALUE holders. Additionally, the model incentives VALUE holders with vETH and vUSD to cover gas costs. The platform will continue to evolve through community participation to best serve its interests.

**3. Profitability**

VALUE will utilize flexible and optimized vault strategies that support small caps tokens/coins. Vault strategies developed by the team will always be delivered without fees, leaving it to VALUE Holders to decide on appropriate parameters.

Alongside the value vaults, Value DeFi will provide an optimized aggregator that ensures the best possible price/liquidity for trading VALUE. All profit from the aggregator will be distributed to VALUE Holders.

**4. Insurance**

An insurance treasury through contributions of the Value DeFi Protocol team and community funds will be used to engage and integrate an insurance protocol to further reduce risk on behalf of all VALUE stakeholders.
