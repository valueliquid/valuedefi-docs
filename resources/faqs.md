### **Why does the "Knowledge Base" page seem incomplete?**

### **What is staking?**

Staking is the act of locking the tokens stored in your wallet to receive rewards.  

### **When staking, is there a minimum stake?**

No, you can stake as much or as little as you like.  But remember every transaction on the Ethereum network costs gas fees, so, staking a small amount may cost you more in gas than you make back in rewards. 

### **What is gvValue token?**

When you stake in the Governance Vault your Value tokens are converted to gvValue. This allows the auto-compound feature to work.  

### **I’ve claimed my rewards but I can't see the tokens in my wallet?**

You need to ensure you have added the _**token contract address to your wallet**_.

## Farms-as-a-Service \(FaaS\) FAQ

**1\) What is Farms-as-a-Service \(FaaS\)?**  
Launched by Value DeFi, Farms-as-a-Service \(FaaS\) is the quickest and easiest way for new projects to kickstart liquidity of their coin without any upfront payment or cost. No permission is required by Value DeFi. Simply create your FaaS pool and let the community stake to it! Creating a FaaS pool on our platform is a great opportunity for your project to be exposed to a larger audience and it will also generate demand for your token!

**2\) Why would I want to create a FaaS pool for my project?**  
In line with our mission to make DeFi accessible for everyone, we created FaaS to allow new projects to easily deploy their contracts instead of having to spend time on forking and deploying the associated contracts the relevant contracts. With Value Liquid’s Farming Pool Creation UI teams can now create the desired customized liquidity pools and pairs along with flexible ratios, customizable fees, and token contract minter approval for the Liquidity Pool with a couple of clicks. An example would be a pool with USDC/New token 67/23 ratio with a 0.60% swap fee that has token minting per block just like Sushiswap.

**3\) Is there a cost associated with the creation of a FaaS pool?**  
There is no fee associated with the creation of a FaaS pool other than the network gas fee required to get it setup on the blockchain.

**4\) I’m ready to move forward and create my first FaaS pool… what do I need to do?**  
              **• Step 1 -** Log into [https://valueliquid.io/\#/faas](https://valueliquid.io/#/faas)  
              **• Step 2 -** Click the “_Create FaaS pool_” button  
              **• Step 3** - Complete all the required fields  
              **• Step 4** - Submit your pool to the blockchain with the push of a button and voila!

As a reminder, no change can be made to a FaaS pool once it is created! This was done by design to protect current stakers.

**5\) How long does it take to setup a FaaS pool?**  
 Assuming you know the pool parameters for your pool, getting it up-and-running shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes!

**6\) What are the pool parameters required to create a FaaS pool?**  
             ****• _The pair of tokens_  
             ****• _The pool weight_ \(i.e. 98-2%\)  
             ****• _The reward token_  
             • _Reward per block_ \(\# of coins allocated as rewards per ETH block for liquidity providers in this pool\)  
             ****• _Lock reward percentage_ \(% of distributed rewards locked until a certain ETH block height is reached\)  
             ****• _Reward start and end blocks_  
             ****• _Vesting start and end blocks_ \(ETH block height at which the pool starts distributing locked rewards to liquidity providers\)
