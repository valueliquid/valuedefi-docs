# vUSD & vETH Tokens

**What are vUSD & vETH Tokens used for?**

vUSD & vETH are the base tokens of our lending protocol and they are pegged to the USD & Ethereum price. This can be done through rebasing, the same way Ampleforth works.  
  
While more information is still to be released, this [article](https://valuedefi.medium.com/value-defi-mid-october-mega-update-e958f6e67c1b) is an excerpt from what is currently known.

**vUSD/vETH Use Case**

Initially, vUSD/vETH was planned as an elastic supply experiment, or rebase coin, using one tenth of the treasury fund to support price with VALUE for each positive rebase.

When the protocol evolved to become a full-suite DeFi ecosystem, we wanted to repurpose vUSD/vETH to a more elegant purpose that benefits the community and ensures that it is more [mission-driven](https://valuedefi.io/vision-mission). This concept is inspired by one of our community members, @Whose Forgotten, who shared his thoughts in this [article](https://gov.valuedefi.io/t/vusd-veth-lending-that-changes-the-game/885).

Today, we are announcing the creation of a **decentralized lending platform** that uses our Liquid DEX technology as its foundation and vUSD/vETH as its base currency.

Due to the scope of this announcement, further details about this new vUSD/vETH platform will be revealed in a separate article.
